				<h4>Initial Client Reactions</h4>
				<p>The time window between initial design delivery and client reaction can be tense for me. Thankfully I often receive comments like these:</p>
				<ul class="quote">
					<li>
						The page looks FANTASTIC!!! I'm so impressed and relieved. Lets def talk tomorrow or Weds and go through everything in detail. I'm so happy...Thanks!
						<span>- Beth</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						First impression: AWESOME! Slick, professional, simple but with high-end design elements. Well done. Let's build this suckah...
						<span>- DSon</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						Yo Aaron this is FANTASTIC! Please call me ASAP. <span>- Alex</span>
					</li>
					<li>  
						I love where you are going with this! The front page is just along the lines I had in mind. I think you do an outstanding job of combining design, simplicity, warmth, and function. I like very much the photo you chose. I really like the curves you introduced that both remind one of the data we track and point the eye towards the tabs for seeking more information. I like the way the logo goes with the everything else. And I like very much how things have been aligned. I also really like the logo and agree we should go with the middle one. Thanks!! <span>- Saul</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						These are awesome and client loved them. Thanks again for your great work!<span>- Chip</span>
					</li>
					<li>
					    We told you in person, but just wanted to let you know again that the design is awesome. Well done!<span>- David</span>
                    </li>
